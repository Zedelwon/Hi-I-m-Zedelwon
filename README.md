# Hi-I-m-Zedelwon
This is a story, of a boy named..
Currently I spend a lot of time walking my dog, getting into a healthier groove with eating and learning about nutrition. I haven't stepped into the gym yet, but I will be soon! I also enjoy the occasional game and youtube videos.
I'm a Publix Deli pro who's breaking into IT, currently learning the ropes on how to get started and perhaps get my feet wet to get into the IT field of Publix with a focus on learning and managing cloud services within Publix.
Don't have any ideas as far as collaboratoins seeing that I'm just now getting into the IT groove.
You can find me @Zedelwon on twitter, usually liking memes, tech announcements and tagging my lovely gf wholesome content.
